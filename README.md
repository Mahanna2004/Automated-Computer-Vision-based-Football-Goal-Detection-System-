To run this code, use any of the 4 .py codes given.

The file for the goal detection model, and the trial video files to be used, have been uploaded to seperate drive links, and the links have been given in the repository as .txt files, appropriately named.

Just change the location of the goal detection model, and the input and output video paths in the codes, according to where you download and run those files. 

The rest can be kept as is, and the codes can be runned.
